        <h1>Hello everyone! This is the about page.</h1>
        <p class="lead">This is the about page for the mini-project for IS601.<br>Let's talk about game theory. <br>Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered "one-player games". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory, operations research, and areas of artificial intelligence, particularly AI planning (with uncertainty) and multi-agent system. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using Markov decision processes (MDP)</p>
